Creating a detailed workflow diagram for a DevSecOps architecture involving AWS CodePipeline, GitHub, SonarQube, and Amazon ECS with quality gates would involve several components and interactions. Below is a simplified representation of such a workflow:

Explanation:

Developers push code changes to a GitHub repository.
AWS CodePipeline is triggered either manually or automatically upon code changes.
The Source stage of the pipeline fetches the source code from the GitHub repository.
The Build stage uses AWS CodeBuild to build and test the code. This includes running unit tests and generating artifacts.
The SonarQube Quality Gate Check stage analyzes the code quality using SonarQube, ensuring adherence to coding standards and identifying potential vulnerabilities or bugs.
The Deploy stage deploys the tested and quality-checked code to an Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) cluster.
The Manual Approval stage requires manual approval before deploying to the production environment. This step allows for human verification and validation before promoting changes to production.
Finally, the application is deployed to the production ECS environment, where it serves end users.
